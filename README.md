Smart Photo Sorter is a simple and intuitive photo management app that helps users quickly organize large collections of images. Users can upload a folder of photos and review them one by one, selecting “Yes” to keep important pictures or “No” to skip them. All selected photos are automatically saved to a chosen destination folder.

The project focuses on speed, ease of use, and a clean user experience, making photo sorting faster and less overwhelming compared to manual file management.
